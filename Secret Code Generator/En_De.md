This is a Secret Code Generator. It can encode or decode a message.

To encode a message, enter 'E' and then the message you want to encode. To decode a message, enter 'D' and then the message you want to decode.

The message can be a single word or a sentence. If the message is a single word, it will be encoded or decoded using a simple reversal algorithm. If the message is a sentence, it will be encoded or decoded using a more complex algorithm that involves adding and removing random letters.

Here is an example of how the code works:

```
Enter 'E' or 'D' to encode or decode a message: E
Enter your message: Hello World
Hello World encoded: dlroW olleH

Enter 'E' or 'D' to encode or decode a message: D
Enter your message: dlroW olleH
Hello World decoded: Hello World
```
