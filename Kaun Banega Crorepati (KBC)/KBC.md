This is a code for the game Kaun Banega Crorepati.

The code is divided into 3 parts:

1. The first part is the welcome message.
2. The second part is the list of questions.
3. The third part is the list of prizes.

The code starts by printing the welcome message.

The second part of the code is the list of questions. The questions are stored in a list called `questions`.

The third part of the code is the list of prizes. The prizes are stored in a list called `prizes`.

The code then starts a loop that iterates over the list of questions. In each iteration, the code prints the question and asks the user to enter their answer. The user's answer is stored in a variable called `x`.

The code then checks if the user's answer is correct. If the answer is correct, the code prints a message saying that the answer is correct and the user wins the prize associated with that question. If the answer is incorrect, the code prints a message saying that the answer is incorrect and the user ends up with the prize associated with the previous question.

The code then breaks out of the loop.
