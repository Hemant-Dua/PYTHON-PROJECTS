This program is to generate the Fibonacci series.

The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The first two numbers in the series are 0 and 1.

The function `fib_series()` takes an integer as input and returns the Fibonacci series up to that number.

The first step is to check if the input number is 0 or 1. If it is, the function returns the number itself.

If the input number is greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself to get the Fibonacci numbers for the two numbers before the input number. The function then adds these two numbers together and returns the result.

The program takes an input number from the user and then calls the `fib_series()` function to generate the Fibonacci series. If the input number is negative, the program prints an error message.

Here is an example of the program in action:

```python
Enter number: 5
0
1
1
2
3
5
