## Python Quine Program

A quine is a program that prints its own source code. This is a simple example of a Python quine:

```python
x='x=%r;print(x%%x)';print(x%x)
```

The first line of the program defines the variable `x` as a string that contains the following code:

```python
print(x%%x)
```

The second line of the program prints the value of `x`, which is the same as the first line of the program. This results in the program printing its own source code.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the program works:

1. The first line of the program defines the variable `x` as a string that contains the following code:

```python
print(x%%x)
```

2. The second line of the program prints the value of `x`, which is the same as the first line of the program. This results in the program printing its own source code.

3. The program continues to print its own source code until it reaches the end of the file.
