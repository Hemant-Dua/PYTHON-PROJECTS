This is a Rock Paper Scissors game.

The game is played between two players, where each player chooses one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The rules of the game are as follows:

* Rock beats scissors
* Paper beats rock
* Scissors beats paper

The game is played in a series of rounds, and the first player to win two rounds wins the game.

To play the game, run the following command:

```
python RPS.py
```

The game will then prompt you to choose an action. You can choose from "R" for rock, "P" for paper, or "S" for scissors.

Once you have chosen an action, the game will randomly choose an action for the computer. The game will then display the results of the round and determine the winner.

The game will continue until one of the players wins two rounds.

Here is an example of a game in progress:
